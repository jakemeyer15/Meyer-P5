   Comparator   
   Jake Meyer

   This is a program that sorts a dictionary canonically and determines if two words are anagrams.

   Steps to run program:
1. Navigate to the Meyer_proj5 directory
2. Type into the command prompt: "make compile" (all files will be compiled)
3. Type into the command prompt: "make run" (an example of the program will be run with a sample
   dictionary and the words "shoe" and "hose"). You should see a new file titled "sorted-output.txt."
4. If you would like to run the program with a custom dictionary file or other words, you can 
   manually type in the arguments:
     - Type "java P5_Detective your_dictionary_file.txt your_word1 your_word2"
     - Replace "your_dictionary_file.txt" with the name of the dictionary file you would like to use
     - Replace "your_word1" with the first word you would like to compare
     - Replace "your_word2" with the the second word you would like to compare
